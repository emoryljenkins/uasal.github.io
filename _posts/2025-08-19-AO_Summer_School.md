# AO Summer School 2025 - MARCUS KLUPAR

## Day 1 (Travel to UCSC)
I woke up early on sunday morning as excitement about the coming week kept me from my slumber. Katie, Josh, Parker, and I stoped for some breakfast at the Tucson airport and waited for boarding to start. As we waited, I qickly realized that I was a second class citizen in the eyes of delta airlines. Josh, the most experienced traveler with numerous trips to Chile, enjoyed a upgrade to first class while I suffered in the last row with a chiar that would not recline.

After a quick flight we landed in LAX to catch another connecting flight to the tech hub of America and the "Heart of Sillison Valley", the San Jose airport. In the San Jose airport we enoyed multiple ad campaigns about AI and how it will improve my work (Will AI push to main?). From here we needed to catch a quick 45 minute uber from the airport to the UCSC campus. However, once we started drving we ran into immense traffic due to a car accident (Why does San Jose only have one road and so many people?). Our uber driver, who spoke no Enlish, bobbed and weaved trying to get us to campus in a timly manner. But alas to no avail we had to tough out the traffic. A 45 minute uber slowly and with much agony tunred into a 2+ hour trip. He pulled out google translate and told us that he was sorry for the inconvience but hinted that he had an idea to pass the time. He whipped out his ipad, placed it on the dash and opened Netflix. He selected the movie "Happy Gilmore 2" in english with Spanish subtittles and english narration, which is arguably the only way to watch this movie. Time flied and eventualy we made it the the UCSC campus where we then checked into out dorm rooms.

After checking into our rooms, we met somefriends from the Gemini telescope and the University of Victoria. We decided to travel down to Santa Cruz and explore the city.

## Day 2 (Day 1 of Summer School)

Day 2 started off early with breakfast at the college 9 and 10 dining halls (The food was exactly as you would exspect and gave flash backs to my freshman year). The summer school then begain promply at 9am where we enjoyed great talks from Becky Jenson-Clem (Introduction to AO for astronomy), Becky and Phil Hinz (AO the game), Renate Kupke (Introduction to Ray Optics), Nicole Putnam (Introduction to AO for vision science). In these talks we learned valuable information that would prove vital for the hands on labs that would take place in the coming days. In addtion to these talks, students presented there work in a poster session.

Day 2 ended with a reception at the CfAO Attrium where we got our eye balls measured...

## Day 3 

Day 3 started off in a similar fashion to day 2, however, I was more excited to get down and dirty with the concepts of wavefront sensing and recostruction. We learned the theory behind the Shack-Hartman WFS and the Pyrimid WFS in additon to some others. We next transition from presentations to hands on labs, where we go to build and play with our own AO kit.

## Day 4

Day 4 continues with presentation and labs. For the presntation portion we learned about atmospheric turbulence (Saavidra Perera), deformable mirros (Phil Hinz), and Laser Guide Stars (Jessica Lu). My favorite presentation was the one from Phil where we learned about the intraction matrix, which mathmatically connects the WFS to the actuators on the deformable mirror (Im a sucker for anything remotly related to controls). In the lab portion of Day 4 we got to build / align our own WFS. We placed a Shack-Hartman WFS in our "telescope" and were able to see the grid of dots through our camera. We then used the same Shack-Hartment WFS but moved it to a focal plane to create a makeshift pyramid WFS. Suprisingly it worked very well.

We also got a tour of the SEAL and UCO shops.

## Day 5

Day 5 marched on with presentations from Nour Skaf (Control Theroy), Bruce Macintosh (Error Budgets), and Emiel Por (AO Simulations). I enjoyed the control theroy talk but quickly realized that the systems I am used to encountering in controls are inheritly different than those used to describe control systems. The HCIpy tutorial given by Emiel was also intriguing.

## Day 6 (Final Day)

Day 6 made headway, you guessed it, in the same way as the previous days. I was interested in the astrophotonics talk by Kevin Bundy. In this talk I learned about phontic logic gates which appearently can cuase phase kicks (goodbye traditinal DM, AHAH I JOKE). Fnally we enjoyed an amazing talk about AO in space which was presented by Rus Belikov. He presented a high level overview of how AO system in conjunction with coronographs work. He then dived a little deeper in to EFC and other specle nulling methods. Overall, I enjoyed this talk since I now feel like I have enough basic knowledge to understand what other people in my lab have been talking about for the past two years....

Fianlly, we ended our AO summer school journy with awards ... that were based on our eye ball measurements from earlier in the week. We have a few winners from our very own sister lab, MagAO-x. Josh won the worst opitc messuring a strehl of just 1%. His award was title the Hubble Space Telescope Award <sub>(before the manned mission to fix the opic)</sub>. Parker won the Adaptive Optic award for the pupil with the larges diamerter change between measurments. Unfortunalty Katie and I did not win any awards, which initially made us sad but we quickly remebered that not winning an award usually means eyes are average.

After a long week of fun learning and hands on experiences, a group of us decided to explore the city of Santa Cruz before we bid goodbye. We headed down to the boardwalk and watch Josh, Parker, and Andre jump into the pacific ocean. 

Later, we hung out at the arcade and enjoyed some fun games.

Finaly, we hit the karaoke bar where, to my suprise, I enjoyed watching Josh and Katie lose their voices.


## All in ALL
From the lessons learned, to the friendships formed, to the rock-hard dorm room mattress, AO Summer School was an unforgettable experience—one that a mere blog can’t fully capture. And with that, I bid farewell to AO Summer School, and to you, dear reader.
