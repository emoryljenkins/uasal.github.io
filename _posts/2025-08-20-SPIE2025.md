## Polarization aberration modeling of internal occulters for coronagraphs

The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) coronagraph instrument will need to block starlight so effectively that only one in every $10^{10}$ photons reaching the telescope makes it to the science camera. Otherwise, light from a planet orbiting the star will be buried below the level of the starlight. This is about 100 times the performance of the current generation of space coronagraphs, requiring a significant advancement in starlight rejection. At such extreme contrasts, every optical component must be analyzed for leakage due to imperfections in manufacturing or even the underlying physics that can cause unwanted starlight to reach the science camera. For components with small features, the interaction of the electric and magnetic fields with interfaces of different materials can lead to starlight leakage that may limit performance. This paper considers the Lyot occulter, a small metal dot used by the Lyot family of coronagraph instruments to block the image of a star from reaching the science camera. We use a numerical simulation of Maxwell's equations to estimate the impact of various Lyot occulter geometries on starlight leakage. With these results, we find that starlight leakage from Lyot occulting masks is a non-negligible but mitigatable source of leakage at the required level of performance for the HWO.
